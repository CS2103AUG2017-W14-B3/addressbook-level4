== Project: HitMeUp
HitMeUp is an address book application designed with the sociable user in mind. It aims to provide a one stop solution for every need: To contact, keep up
and organise.
With the cloud import feature, a user would be able to get the application
up and running a matter of minutes. Being able to group your contacts, and view each group at a glance affords
convenience like never before. Social integration to Instagram and Twitter is baked in, allowing users to view profiles
in the application itself without having to switch to a browser or check their phone.

=== Enhancement Added: Google Contacts Import

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=import]

#End of Extract#

==== Justification

---

Users of HitMeUp would want a quick and easy way to get started with the application, especially if they have a large amount of contacts. +
Having an import function that takes in all their contacts from Google in a matter of seconds allows them to not worry about the transition
to a new application.


==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=import]

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Added: Location Command

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=location]

#End of Extract#

==== Justification

---

While having the location of a contact is useful, it is an inconvenience to the user to copy the address into Google Maps
manually in order to figure out the directions to a friend's place. As such, the location command allows the user to directly view the location of a contact
in HitMeUp without having to switch to a browser.

=== Enhancement Proposed: iCloud Import

==== External behavior

---
The iCloud import would be invoked by typing `iCloud` as the parameter for the import command instead of `Google`.

---

==== Justification

---
While import from Google Contacts is available, there may be users who have their contacts stored on iCloud instead and would prefer
to import from iCloud instead of having to manually add their contacts. Having this feature would allow the user the freedom of choice in
which cloud service to import their contacts from, and would thus allow HitMeUp to be a more versatile application.


==== Implementation

---

The iCloud import would be facilitated by the `CloudKit JS` framework provided by Apple in their Developer Program. However, as there are no native Java APIs
provided by Apple for usage, the import would have to be facilitated using HTTP requests in contrast to the implementation of the Google import.
