<div class="paragraph">
<p>The import mechanism is facilitated by Google&#8217;s People API. It supports reading contacts from the user&#8217;s personal Google account and parsing them into a format that can be added to the address book. The import mechanism only supports
adding contacts from Google but iCloud import is scheduled for release in a later version of the application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before any importing can be done, the address book has to be authorized to request data from Google&#8217;s API. This is done using the OAuth 2.0 protocol as it is the standard used by Google for all of their APIs.
As there are libraries from Google that make authorization easier, these libraries have been used in the implementation of the import mechanism.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Client information such as the Client ID and Client secret are first loaded into a GoogleClientSecrets object. After which, A GoogleAuthorizationCodeFlow object is set up
using the GoogleClientSecrets, HttpTransport, JsonFactory objects and the scope of access desired to the user&#8217;s Google Contacts data. In this implementation, we have chosen read-only as we are only importing
contacts and no modification to the data on Google&#8217;s side will be performed. A AuthorizationCodeInstalledApp object is then created using the previously mentioned GoogleAuthorizationCodeFlow object, and also a LocalServerReceiver object which allows the application to listen on the local
web server for the authorization code that is provided when the user gives consent to access his/her data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After which, the authorization flow can finally begin. The following sequence diagram illustrates this process.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A token is first requested by the AuthorizationCodeInstalledApp object, and a page for the user to login to his/her Google account is shown in the System&#8217;s default web browser.
Once the user provides consent for the address book to access the data, an authorization code is sent back to the local web server where it is received by the LocalServerReceiver object and passed onto the GoogleAuthorizationCodeFlow
object so that the code can be exchanged for a token. Once the token is received, a Credential object is created and returned to the executeUndoableCommand method.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Credential object is then passed to a <code>retrieveContacts</code> method that creates a <code>PeopleService</code> object that allows the application to interact with Google&#8217;s People API.
The parameters used to get the list of the user&#8217;s connections (Google&#8217;s term for contacts) are as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>PageSize: 1000
PersonFields: Names, EmailAddresses, PhoneNumbers</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A PageSize (the number of connections to fetch) of 1000 is chosen as it is the amount of contacts that the address book should be able to hold before it gets sluggish.
The PersonFields chosen are the ones most relevant to storing a contact, and more fields such as addresses will be added in future updates.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>retrieveContacts</code> will then pass the <code>List&lt;Person&gt;</code> of connections back to the caller and finally, a <code>importContacts</code> method will be called on the <code>List&lt;Person&gt;</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>importContacts</code> method is implemented using the <code>Task</code> class from JavaFX and takes care of importing contacts to the address book. <code>importContacts</code> is run in a separate <code>Thread</code> from the main program.
It parses every connection from the <code>List&lt;Person&gt;</code> using a <code>convertPerson</code> method that converts a <code>Person</code> object to a <code>seedu.address.model.person.Person</code> such that it can be added to the address book.
A progress bar for importing is also shown to the user, implemented using the <code>progressProperty()</code> method of the <code>Task</code> class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following sequence diagram shows how the import operation works:</p>
</div>

<div class="content">
<img src="../images/ImportSequenceDiagram.png" alt="ImportSequenceDiagram" width="800">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The import mechanism is built upon an <code>UndoableCommand</code>, which means that any changes made by the command can be easily reversed by calling the
<code>undo</code> command.</p>

<h4 id="design-considerations"><a class="link" href="#design-considerations">Design Considerations</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Aspect:</strong> How import executes<br>
<strong>Alternative 1 (current choice):</strong> Individually adds each contact.<br>
<strong>Pros:</strong> User is able to see each contact being added.<br>
<strong>Cons:</strong> Slower than adding retrieved contacts all at once as the data has to be written to disk every time a contact is added individually<br>
<strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Contacts are only added after every single <code>Person</code> is parsed<br>
<strong>Pros:</strong> Faster than adding as soon as each <code>Person</code> is parsed as data is written all at once, instead of multiple times<br>
<strong>Cons:</strong> Requires a new method <code>addAllInList</code> to be implemented in model, which only has limited use as import is the only command doing a batch
addition of contacts</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Aspect:</strong> How import progress is shown to the user<br>
<strong>Alternative 1 (current choice):</strong> Show a pop-up progress window indicating how many contacts have been added<br>
<strong>Pros:</strong> Intuitive for the user to understand<br>
<strong>Cons:</strong> Difficult to implement as importing contacts takes a (relatively) long time and thus, blocks the JavaFX thread from updating the UI in a timely manner. As such, the progress bar will not be updated until the <code>importContacts</code> function is completed.
Threading has to be used to allow the progress bar to update as the <code>importContacts</code> method is running.<br>
<strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Show the user how many contacts have been added in <code>ResultDisplay</code> <br>
<strong>Pros:</strong> Easy to implement as no new UI elements have to be added<br>
<strong>Cons:</strong> Not as user-friendly as having a progress bar<br></p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Aspect:</strong> Implementation of authorization<br>
<strong>Alternative 1 (current choice):</strong> Pop-up the authorization page in the user&#8217;s default browser<br>
<strong>Pros:</strong> Easy for the user to authorize as they may already be logged in to their Google account on their browsers.<br>
<strong>Cons:</strong> Takes the focus away from the main application to the user&#8217;s default browser, which may be a jarring user experience.<br>
<strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Use the existing browser panel to show the authorization page<br>
<strong>Pros:</strong> Clearer for the user to understand and focus is kept on the main application.<br>
<strong>Cons:</strong> Requires implementing a new class to listen on the local web server for the authorization code instead of using the provided <code>LocalServerReceiver</code> from the Google Client Library.<br></p>
